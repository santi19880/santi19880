- 👋 Hi, I’m @santi19880
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to become a data analyst.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning from Google's Data Analytics Career Certificate.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on various projects once I'm able to help.
- 📫 You can PM here if you want.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/him.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've been working analyzing web traffic from Google Analytics for over a decade. Never got to learn anything else other than G. Analytics, Looker Studio and spreadsheets because it isn't required at my current job.
